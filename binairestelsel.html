            <h2>Introduction to Coding Languages</h2>
            <p>In this section, we'll explore various coding languages and their uses.</p>
            <p>. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Purpose:1. HTML
                            is used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements and layout of web documents.
                Key Features: HTML uses tags to define various elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. It is not a programming language but a markup language.</li>
                <li>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
                
                Purpose: CSS is used to style and format HTML documents. It controls the presentation and layout of web pages.
                Key Features: CSS allows you to apply styles like colors, fonts, margins, and borders to HTML elements, making your web pages visually appealing.</li>
                <li> 3. JavaScript:
                
                Purpose: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used for adding interactivity to web pages. It can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a page in real-time.
                Key Features: JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic web applications, form validation, animations, and more. It's supported by all major web browsers.</li>
                <li>4. Python:
                
                Purpose: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's used for web development, data analysis, automation, and more.
                Key Features: Python emphasizes readability and clean code. It has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of packages and frameworks.</li>
                <li>5. Java:
                
                Purpose: Java is a versatile, platform-independent, object-oriented programming language. It's commonly used for building desktop applications, web applications (using Java Servlets), and Android apps.
                Key Features: Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy allows it to run on various platforms. It's known for its strong type system and memory management.</li>
                <li>6. C++:
                
                Purpose: C++ is a general-purpose programming language often used for system programming, game development, and high-performance applications.
                Key Features: C++ combines both high-level and low-level features. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms.</li>
                <li>7. Ruby:
                
                Purpose: Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its elegant syntax and productivity. It's commonly used in web development, thanks to the Ruby on Rails framework.
                Key Features: Ruby emphasizes developer happiness and readability. It promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.</li>
                <li>8. PHP:
                
                Purpose: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It's used for creating dynamic web pages, managing databases, and building web applications.
                Key Features: PHP is embedded within HTML and is widely used for creating web applications like content management systems (e.g., WordPress)</li>
                <li>9. SQL (Structured Query Language):
                
                Purpose: SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases. It's essential for data manipulation and retrieval.
                Key Features: SQL allows you to create, update, and retrieve data from databases using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
                These are just a few of the many programming and markup languages used in various domains of software development and web technology. Each language has its unique features and use cases, making them valuable tools for different purposes.</li></p>
