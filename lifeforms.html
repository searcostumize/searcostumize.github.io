            <h2>Sentient vs. Intelligent Lifeforms</h2>
            <p>When discussing lifeforms, two terms that often come up are "sentient" and "intelligent." While these terms are related, they refer to different aspects of a lifeform's capabilities and consciousness.</p>

            <h3>Sentient Lifeforms</h3>
            <p>A sentient lifeform possesses self-awareness and consciousness. Sentience allows a lifeform to perceive and experience its surroundings, emotions, and sensations. It is the capacity to feel and react to stimuli.</p>
            <p>Sentient beings are capable of subjective experiences and can have emotions, desires, and the ability to make choices based on their feelings and perceptions.</p>

            <h3>Intelligent Lifeforms</h3>
            <p>An intelligent lifeform goes beyond sentience; it demonstrates the ability to think, reason, problem-solve, and learn. Intelligence involves cognitive processes that allow a lifeform to adapt to its environment, solve complex problems, and use knowledge to achieve goals.</p>
            <p>Intelligent beings may exhibit advanced problem-solving skills, creativity, and the capacity to manipulate their environment to meet their needs.</p>

            <p>While sentience and intelligence often overlap in many lifeforms, it is possible to imagine scenarios where a lifeform may be sentient but not highly intelligent, or vice versa.</p>
